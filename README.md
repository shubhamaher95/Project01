# 🎓 Mini Data Science Project — Student Data Analysis

👋 Hi, I'm **Shubham Aher**, an Aspiring Data Scientist currently working on real-world datasets to build my data analytics skills.

This repository documents my **learning journey**, where I apply Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries to practical mini-projects.

---

## 🗓️ Day 1 — Project Kickoff

* Loaded a student dataset (CSV file) using **Pandas**.
* Explored the dataset with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`.
* Checked for missing data using `.isnull()`.
* Practiced filtering rows and columns with Pandas indexing.

---

## 🗓️ Day 2 — Data Cleaning & Manipulation

* Handled missing values with `.fillna()` and `.dropna()`.
* Used `.groupby()` to analyze class-wise performance (FY, SY, TY).
* Counted student distribution with `.value_counts()`.
* Sorted students by marks using `.sort_values()`.
* Applied **NumPy** functions for quick statistics (mean, median, mode).

---

## 🗓️ Day 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Checked overall **data distribution** using histograms.
* Identified **outliers** with boxplots.
* Reviewed categorical vs numerical features.
* Calculated correlations using `.corr()` and visualized with heatmaps.

---

## 🗓️ Day 4 — Data Visualization

* Plotted bar charts of student counts per class.
* Visualized marks distribution with histograms.
* Used **Seaborn heatmap** to display feature correlations.
* Highlighted **top 10 students** by marks with bar plots.

---

## 🗓️ Day 5 — Feature Engineering

* Created new columns such as `Total Marks` and `Average Marks`.
* Classified students into **Pass/Fail** or **Grade categories**.
* Converted categorical columns into numerical format using `.map()` and `pd.get_dummies()`.

---

## 🗓️ Day 6 — Advanced Data Analysis

* Compared **average marks** across FY, SY, and TY.
* Analyzed gender-based performance (if gender column available).
* Grouped by multiple attributes (e.g., Class + Gender).
* Found **top scorer per class** using `.groupby().max()`.

---

## 🗓️ Day 7 — Reporting & Insights

* Documented main insights, for example:

  * TY students showed higher average marks than FY and SY.
  * Female students performed slightly better in Mathematics compared to male students.
  * A small group of top scorers contributed to the majority of high grades.
* Exported cleaned dataset with `.to_csv()`.

---

## 🗓️ Day 8 — Project Finalization

* Organized Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step sections.
* Added **visualizations and screenshots** in the repo.
* Updated README with clear insights and learning outcomes.
* Final commit to GitHub with structured documentation.

---
