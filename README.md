# Mini Data Science Project — Student Data Analysis

👋 Hi, I'm **Shubham Aher**, an Aspiring Data Scientist currently working on real-world datasets to build my data analytics skills.

This repository documents my **learning journey**, where I apply concepts of Python, Pandas, NumPy, and other data science tools to practical mini-projects.

---

## 🗓️ Day 1 — Project Kickoff
- Loaded a student dataset (CSV file) using **Pandas**.
- Explored basic **DataFrames operations** like `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
- Checked for missing data and learned how to handle them using `.isnull()`, `.fillna()`, and `.dropna()`.
- Filtered specific columns and rows using **Pandas indexing and conditions**.

---

## 🗓️ Day 2 — Data Manipulation & Cleaning
- Applied **groupby()** to analyze class-wise student performance (FY, SY, TY).
- Used `.value_counts()` to get distribution of students per class.
- Sorted students by marks using `.sort_values()`.
- Practiced using **NumPy** for basic numerical operations (mean, median, mode calculations).
- Cleaned the dataset by filling missing values with meaningful default values.

## 📸 Screenshots
Included are screenshots of my VS Code workspace, where I executed data loading, filtering, and cleaning tasks.

## 🔜 Coming Next:
- Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Insights and patterns from the dataset

## 📚 Skills Applied:
- Python Basics
- Pandas for Data Manipulation
- NumPy for Numerical Operat
